# What is Looper?

Create new audio tracks by combining and looping multiple audio files.

## Dynamic music

Let's say you're making a game. The player is running around in a vast, expansive world... when all of a sudden, a foe appears!

Maybe you **want** a completely different soundtrack to start playing. But maybe you don't. Maybe you want to start switching out instruments and adjusting the current layers of your songs so that the transitions is smooth and natural.

## Limits

Looper currently only really works well with clips under 45 seconds, since it relies heavily on the Web Audio API's buffering features. In the future, I may look into expanding this for more complicated pieces
